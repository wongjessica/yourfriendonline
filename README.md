#Inspiration
As many students struggle with the college admissions process and adapting to their new environments, we wanted to create a reliable source of information that students can easily obtain without going through complicated searches. We also wanted to give students the ability to voice their opinions and be comforted throughout their whole academic career.

#What it does
yourfriend.online is a website which features 3 chatbots: Help Bot, Bliss, and Cobalt. Students can request for general information about services and offices located in their college. Bliss focuses on mental health and provides a safe space for students to discuss about their feelings. If students would like to share their voice, Cobalt conducts a survey regarding different aspects of their college.

#How we built it
We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as open-source code as a base for the chatbots. Research was conducted during the project to include information about colleges on the general website and for Help Bot to aid students.

#Challenges we ran into
Originally we had difficulty deciding on what chatbot(s) should be created. We decided to create three chatbots so each has a set of unique functions. We also struggled with making these chatbots available on other platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Slack.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we were able to cover three distinct sets of features within 36 hours!

#What we learned
We learned specific functions on JavaScript and how to deploy to Google Cloud App Engine.

#What's next for yourfriend.online
We would love to transfer this feature to a Facebook Messenger bot!
